## Webscraping
This is an assignment during the recruitment process for an internship that I applied to.

Task: retrieve the website of the companies from this page: https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/

First, I inspected the HTML code of the website. Normal procedure using Beautifulsoup could not scrape the information that I want, so I saved the HTML portion that I needed in a txt file, and then extracted the required information from the txt file.

The results were saved in an Excel file.
